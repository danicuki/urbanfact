Have you seen someone doing a good or a bad thing for your city? Then take a picture and post it to Twitter using the hashtag #urbanfact (or, in portuguese, #fatourbano).

We'll add it to our site where other people can vote and comment. If we have the geolocation for that tweet, we'll also add it to a map.

Praising the good acts will serve an example for others, whereas by exposing the people who do wrong we hope to discourage them to repeat their acts.
